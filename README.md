Packal Repository
==========

This repository hosts Workflows for Alfred 2.

All files in here are pushed automatically from http://packal.org. All are user-contributed and have been subjected to a virus scan.

You can clone this repository, but it should be fairly big. We recommend using the website to discover which Workflows are relevant for you.

We do not accept pull requests for any of the files because, well, they're user contributed and not developed here.

This repository has three functions:
1. To be the primary host for these Workflows (all download links from http://packal.org point here).
2. To be the remote source for the Packal Workflow's updating abilities (still in development).
3. To be a backup in case the Packal server goes down (all workflow files are also on the webserver).
